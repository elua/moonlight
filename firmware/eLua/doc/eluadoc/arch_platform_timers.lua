  [[$Virtual timers$ were added to eLua to overcome some limitations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>there are generally few hardware timers available, some of which might be dedicated (thus not usable directly by eLua).</li>
    <li>many times it is difficult to share a hardware timer between different parts of an application because of conflicting requirements. Generally it's not possible to have timers that can
        achieve long delays and high accuracy at the same time (this is especially true for systems that have 16 bit or even smaller timers).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In this respect, $virtual timers$ are a set of timers that share a single hardware timer. It is possible, in this way, to have a hardware timer that can implement 4, 8 or more virtual/software
  timers. There are a few drawbacks to this approach:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the hardware timer used to implement the virtual timers must generally be dedicated. In fact it can still be used in "read only mode", which means that the only operations that can
        be executed on it are $PLATFORM_TIMER_OP_READ$, $PLATFORM_TIMER_GET_CLOCK$, $PLATFORM_TIMER_OP_GET_MAX_DELAY$ and $PLATFORM_TIMER_OP_GET_MIN_DELAY$. However,
        since the "read only mode" is not enforced by the code, it is advisable to treat this timer as a dedicated resource and thus make it invisible to eLua by not associating it with 
        an ID.</li>
    <li>the number of virtual timers and their base frequency are fixed at compile time.</li>
    <li>virtual timers are generally used for large delays with low accuracy, since their base frequency should be fairly low (see below).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To $enable$ virtual timers:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>edit $platform_conf.h$ (see @arch_overview.html#platforms@here@ for details) and set $VTMR_NUM_TIMERS$ to the number of desired virtual timers and 
       $VTMR_FREQ_HZ$ to the base frequency of the virtual timers (in hertz). For example:
  ~#define VTMR_NUM_TIMERS       4 // we need 4 virtual timers
#define VTMR_FREQ_HZ          4 // the base clock for the virtual timers is 4Hz~</li>
    <li>in your platform port setup a hardware timer to fire an interrupt at $VTMR_FREQ_HZ$ and call the $cmn_virtual_timer_cb$ function (defined in %src/common.c%) in the 
       timer interrupt handler. For example, if the the interrupt handler is called $timer_int_handler$, do this:
  ~void timer_int_handler( void )
{
  // add code to clear the timer interrupt flag here if needed
  cmn_virtual_timer_cb();
}~</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Note that because of step 2 above you are limited by practical constraints on the value of $VTMR_FREQ_HZ$. If set too high, the timer interrupt will fire too often, thus taking too much
  CPU time. The maximum value depends largely on the hardware and the desired behaviour of the virtual timers, but in practice values larger than 10 might visibly change the behaviour of your 
  system.</p>
  <p>To $use$ a virtual timer, identify it with the constant $VTMR_FIRST_ID$ (defined in %inc/common.h%) plus an offset. For example, $VTMR_FIRST_ID+0$ (or simply
  $VTMR_FIRST_ID$) is the ID of the first virtual timer in the system, and $VTMR_FIRST_ID+2$ is the ID of the third virtual timer in the system.
