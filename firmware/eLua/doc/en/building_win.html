<h3>Building eLua in Windows</h3>
<p>Starting with version 0.7, building <b>eLua</b> in Windows is officialy supported. The following instructions were tested in Windows 7 Professional, but they
should work with little or no modification in any version of Windows 7, Vista or XP. You need to download and install a few things first:</p> 
<ul>
<li><b>a toolchain</b>: building a GCC-based toolchain under Windows is possible, but not easy. We found that the easiest thing to do is to download a pre-built toolchain 
and install it. Currently, all the targets supported by <b>eLua</b> (except i386) have at least one toolchain that runs under Windows:
<ul> 
  <li>For ARM7, ARM9 and Cortex-M3 targets, you can download and install the CodeSourcery Lite Edition (supported by <b>eLua</b> out of the box) from 
  <a href="http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/subscription?@template=lite">here</a>. For reference, the version used in this tutorial is 
  "Sourcery G++ Lite 2009q3-68 for ARM EABI". Future (and some previous) versions of this toolchain should also work. Remember to specify 
  <code>toolchain=codesourcery</code> when using this toolchain (see <a href="building.html#buildoptions">here</a> for details).</li>
  <li>AVR32 has its own Windows based GNU toolchain that can be downloaded from Atmel <a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=4118">here</a>.</li>
</ul></li>   
<li><b>Python</b>: my favourite Windows distribution of Python is <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activepython/">ActivePython</a>. Simply download it and install it. ActivePython
2.6.4.8 will be used in this tutorial. Other Python distribution might work equally well.</li>
<li><b>scons</b>: download the Windows installer package from <a href="http://www.scons.org/download.php">here</a>. For this tutorial, scons 1.2.0 will be used. Remember to install
scons <b>after</b> you install Python. </li>
<li><b>lua</b>: a very good and versatile Lua distribution for Windows is "Lua for Windows", it can be downloaded from <a href="http://luaforwindows.luaforge.net/">here</a>. Besides
Lua itself, it includes a lot of very useful Lua modules, so I highly recommend it. Version 5.1.4.30 of Lua for Windows will be used in this tutorial.</li>
<li><b>svn</b>: if you need to checkout the <b>eLua</b> source code from the SVN repository, you need to install SVN for windows. There are a few precompiled SVN packages for
Windows available, I'm using the Tigris binaries that can be downloaded from <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=8100">here</a>. In this
tutorial I'll use version 1.6.6. If you require developer access (svn+ssh), additional steps are needed to make "svn+ssh" work in Windows. A lot of tutorials
that cover this topic are available, check for example <a href="http://agateau.wordpress.com/2007/07/03/windows-svnssh-and-the-subversion-command-line-client/">this one</a>.</li>
<li><b>gcc</b>: if you want to use the ROMFS precompile feature (see <a href="arch_romfs.html#mode">here</a> for details) you need to build an image of the <b>eLua</b> cross compiler, and you need an i386
toolchain for this. I'm using MinGW for this task, it can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">here</a>. This tutorial uses MinGW version 5.1.6. Note that you
don't need to install MSYS, MinGW should be enough. Cygwin should work equally well, or even Microsoft's Visual Studio (not tested). To build the cross compiler, run
this command from the command line:
  <pre><code>scons -f cross-lua.py</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure that all the programs listed above are added to %PATH%. Most of them do this automatically, or have an option to do this automatically, but some
(for example MinGW) do not and you need to add them to %PATH% manually.</p> 
<p>After you setup your build environment as described above, follow <a href="building.html#configuring">this tutorial</a> to build your <b>eLua</b> image.</p>
