<a name="whatis" /><h3>What is eLua?</h3></a>
<p><strong>eLua</strong>
stands for <strong>Embedded Lua</strong> and the project
aims to offer the full implementation of the 
<a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua Programming Language</a> to the embedded world.
</p>

<p><strong>eLua</strong>
is not a stripped down set of Lua to fit in the embedded environment. Much on the contrary, it strives to
offer the same features as the desktop version of Lua, complementing them with 
specific features for embedded use and discarting the need of an operating
system running on the microcontrollers.
Besides offering different flavors of the full Lua implementation
(like the possibility of choosing between an integer-only and a floating
point numbers implementation),
a lot of work was and will be done in the direction of making Lua
more "embedded-friendly" by augmenting the core language with features
that allow lower memory requirements and faster embedded performance.</p>

<p>Why Lua? Extremely well crafted, Lua is the perfect example of a
minimal, yet fully functional language. 
Although generally advertised as a "scripting
language" (and used accordingly especially in the game industry), it is
also fully capable of running stand-alone programs and web services 
(ex: Adobe Lightroom, World of Warcraft, ...). Its limited
resource requirements make it suitable to a lot of microcontroller
families. The intrinsic high portability of the original Lua code
(which is ANSI C and runs virtually on every platform), combined with the highly portable software
architecture of <b>eLua</b>, allow for easy porting of the project to a large variety 
of architectures. The peripheral access libraries/modules exported by <b>eLua</b> are also portable 
by design, so one could run a Lua program (without or with very few modifications) 
on every <span style="font-weight: bold;">eLua</span> supported platform.
This brings an unprecedent level of portability to the embedded aplications
world. <b>eLua</b> inherits the minimalistic and functional design of Lua, staying 
in line with the well known <b>KISS</b>, <i>Keep It Small and Simple</i> philosophy.</p>

<p>The aim of the project is to have a fully functional Lua development
environment <strong>on the microcontroller itself</strong>,
without the need to install a specific development environment on
the PC side, other than a serial or ehternet console/terminal emulator.</p>
<p>We can't end this short presentation without presenting our project motto: No matter what you do with <b>eLua</b>, always remember to have
Fun with it :)</p>
<br />
<br />
<a name="features"></a><h3>General Features</h3>
<p>As already stated, <b>eLua</b> allows you to run Lua completely on
the
target microcontroller. A fast-growing set of complementary modules is also
provided, for programming <strong>eLua</strong> microcontroller's peripherals. </p>
<p>The following important features are ready or being implemented:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a flexible, configurable build system and a web build service under
  development.</li>
  <li>access to the Lua interpreter on the target MCU via a variety of physical transports
  (RS-232, Ethernet, ...).</li>
  <li>a (mostly) platform independent MCU peripheral library (PIO,
  UART, PWM, SPI, TMR, ADC, NET, CAN, DAC, I2C...)</li>
  <li>a very low footprint embedded ROM file system, easy to port to different types of memory chips and other storage devices</li>
  <li>a small FAT R/W file system layer for SD/MMC cards</li>
  <li>a minimal command "shell", for file operations, environment configuration and other facilities</li>
  <li>tcp/ip network support</li>
  <li>remote procedure calls support. Distributed processing in the embedded world</li>
  <li>an embedded http server</li>
  <li>extended (romable) Lua types, optimized for embedded performance</li>
  <li>terminal/console over Serial and Ethernet protocols</li>
  <li>debugging (directly on the MCU or remotely with the PC)</li>
  <li>rfs support. Remote file sharing on the embedded world</li>
  <li>full and stand alone implementation on all MCUs. No dependency on embedded operating systems</li>
  <li>online and offline access to (same format) documentation and tutorials</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about the functionality (implemented and planned) in <strong>eLua</strong> check <a
href="status.html">our status page</a>.</p>
<p>Porting <strong>eLua</strong> to another compatible platform should be as easy
and
painless as possible. Currently this is restricted to platforms for
which the gcc+newlib combo is available. This restriction will disappear in the near future, as <b>eLua</b> will have its own libc and thus it will be available on a much
broader range of MCUs.</p>
<p>The Lua implementation is the full desktop Lua version and comes in two flavors: "regular Lua"
(using
floating point as the number type) and "integer Lua" (using integers).
"Regular Lua" will be able
to perform floating point operations (slower because the
floating point operations will be emulated in software on the MCU),
while "integer Lua" will only be able to perform operations with
integer numbers (but support for fixed and even floating point can be
added with separate modules) and thus will be faster.</p>
<br />

<a name="audience"></a><h3>Audience</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">eLua</span> has a wide and varied audience, starting from newcomers to the embedded world who want an
easy and powerful environment for prototyping, rapid application
development and quick production, and ranging towards highly skilled developers
that want to extend their programs with the Lua library facilities and
portable features.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">eLua</span>
allows embedded-oriented programmers to use the simplicity and
power of the Lua programming language and to hide the low-level
complexities and platform/architecture-dependent features. With <b>eLua</b>,
the programmer can focus on the actual implementation of his program,
without having to worry about accessing the low-level peripheral 
configuration and data registers, as the platform libraries already
take care of this. This increases productivity and eliminates the often
frustrating task of dealing with platform-specific drivers. </p>
<p>The list below summarizes <b>eLua</b>'s target audience:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Embedded developers that are looking for a fast, easy to use and powerful way of coding.</li>
  <li>First-time
embedded programmers (or simply first time programmers) who are
looking for an easy way to "dive" into the embedded programming world.
eLua is a great learning tool.</li>
  <li>People that aren't really
developers, but still want to be able to prototype an embedded system
fast and painless, without having to learn C for that.</li>
  <li>Embedded
developers who need powerful meta-language mechanisms for complex code
algorithms and data description.</li>
  <li>Field
engineers that can go to their customer site and debug an eLua module on
site, without any preparation at all, since the whole development
environment resides on chip already.</li>
  <li>Final clients and decision makers, who benefits from the fact that
  <b>eLua</b> conceptually transforms hardware into comodities. In systems using
  <b>eLua</b>, replacing field sensor and actuator controllers by diferent models, brands and
  architectures have no impact on the main aplication software.</li>
</ul>
