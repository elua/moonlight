The eLua doc is automatically generated by a Lua script contained here in the distro.
The html doc generated by this script is the exactly the same shown in our online site (www.eluaproject.net)

To generate the doc:
- make sure you have Lua installed in your machine (www.lua.org)
- go to the /doc directory of this distro (you're probably here already :)
- run the script with
  $ lua buildall.lua
- the doc/site structure is generated in a new sub-folder called dist, where you can go and open any .html document. The left-side menu is actually part of the global layout and is included in every page of the doc/site.
- enjoy eLua !
